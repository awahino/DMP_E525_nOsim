# Data open shown in the paper.
The ploted data in paper "A simulation model investigation of neutron-oxygen inelastic scattering and subsequent nucleus deexcitation based on experimental data" are released in this repository.
There are root files (at least, ROOT6.34.08 works) containing the data and example macros to draw the figures in the paper.

## How to make a plot
Just run, for example,
```
root drawFig3.C
```
so that you can get the plots in Fig.3.
For the others, follow the same manner above.

## How to access the data
Please use the root objects to get the data points in the histograms.
